# Hello! ðŸ‘‹

Do you find eslint-plugin-jasmine useful?

Unfortunately, I have little time to maintain it at the moment and would love
some help.

If you're able to isolate an issue or make improvements, a pull request is
gladly welcome.

If you're interested in helping to maintain the repo, please get in touch.
